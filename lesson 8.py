# every object is associated with a type

# identifiers (variables, function names) are binded to objects, we call those binds

# ex: var = 7 would be:

# var binds to 7 which is an instance of int

# bindings can also be rebinded

# type is an instance of type 

# every class is an object of type type

# defining your own classes

# class peepeepoopoo:
    # pass

# in your class you can add any code, however any bindings will become attributes of the class

# dir dir (directory) if you want a list of attributes of an object

# when you call a function as a method of the object of a class that object is taken as a positional arguement

# custom classes are mutable and can be changed, same with objects created within those functions, however you can't change the attributes of objects python gives to you by default

# the self parameter: a parameter that just represents the object within your class
