# for char in "hello":
    # print(char)

# immutable: data that can't be changed (strings, floats, integers)

# mutable: data that can be changed (lists, dictionaries, etc.)

# some methods change data while others make new data

# functions can only make new data

# break: a command that will stop the innermost loop

# continue: skips a specific iteration in a loop when the loop hits it

# format strings: typing "f" before a string to add a variable, removes the need for typecasting, also easier to read

# funnyword = input()

# print(f"you are a {funnyword} ")

# explicit typing vs implicit typing

# explicit typing: code where you need to specify the data type in a varibale  

# implicit typing : code where you don't need to specify the data type in a variable 

# dynamically typed vs statically typed

# dynamic typing: the data type of a variable can be changed later in memory

# static typing: the data type of a variable CANNOT be changed later in memeory

# the advantage of explicit typing is the ability to see the options for methods and specify what a functions return
