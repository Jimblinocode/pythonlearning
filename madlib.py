If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law\n Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his\n chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He\n asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using\n his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was...\n astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I\n was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling\n from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and\n showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't\n want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret.\n I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo\n Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit,\n Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out.\n From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring\n flatly refused to give him, and things escalated.
