You are in room 1. The walls are a garish bright pink, with red and pink hearts adorning them. there is a slimy, viscous white fluid on the ground up to shin level. the goopy fluid sloshes as you walk through it. at the center of this room are two pedestals. to your west is the fortresses exit.
You are in room 2. a vile, ungodly smell hits you the moment you step in. the room is almost completely dark, with the only thing illuminating your surroundings being a computer monitor in the distance. with just that light you can vaguely see mountains of trashbags piled onto eachother, covering the walls. you tread carefully.
You are in room 3. the first thing you see as you enter is a large pulsating mass in the center of the room with what looks like a body dangling off of it. the massive pulsating mass appears to be hoisted by strange tubes and wires attatched to the top of the mass connecting to the ceiling. the room is lit purple, with posters on the walls reading "Rick and Morty" and "The Big Bang Theory" on the left and right walls respectively.
