You are in room 1. The walls are a garish bright pink, with red and pink hearts adorning them. there is a slimy, viscous white fluid on the ground up to shin level. the goopy fluid sloshes as you walk through it. at the center of this room are two pedestals. to your west is the fortresses exit. there is a room to your EAST. there is a room to your SOUTH.
You are in room 2. a vile, ungodly smell hits you the moment you step in. the room is almost completely dark, with the only thing illuminating your surroundings being a computer monitor in the distance. with just that light you can vaguely see mountains of trashbags piled onto eachother, covering the walls. you tread carefully. there is a room to WEST. there is a room to your EAST. there is a room to your SOUTH
You are in room 3. the first thing you see as you enter is a large pulsating mass in the center of the room with what looks like a body dangling off of it. the massive pulsating mass appears to be hoisted by strange tubes and wires attatched to the top of the mass connecting to the ceiling. the room is lit purple, with posters on the walls reading "Rick and Morty" and "The Big Bang Theory" on the left and right walls respectively. the only room is to your WEST. 
You are in room 4. the room is dimly lit and dirty. various chemicals, medicine containers and vials, dusty cups and dusty beakers litter the tables lined along the eastern and western walls with refuse and trash piling the floor beneath. the only room is to your NORTH.
You are in room 5. an intense, suffocating heat blows towards you. The floor beneath you is a path of black volcanic rock which branches off in 2 directions and is surrounded by bubbling lava. the walls around you, also made of black volcanic rock, ooze streams of lava. there is a room to your EAST. there is a room to your SOUTH.
