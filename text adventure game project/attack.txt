you ponder your ORB and fire a Magic Missile at the GIGAREDDITOR. despite his immense intellect and 500D chess skills, he never could have predicted such a simplistic attack to be his downfall (or maybe that was part of his big-brained master plan all along). the Magic Missile hits the GIGAREDDITOR in the face, destroying the head and killing him instantly. The GIGAREDDITOR is dead
you pull out the shirt and show it to the wizard. before the wizard casts his spell (sponsored by the shadow government) the wizard makes the mistake of looking at the shirt. the cringe waves emitted by the shirt force the wizard to cower and run until falling into lava. the FIRE WIZARD is dead.
you gun down the wizard. not being able to anticipate an actual gun being used, the bullets hit him in the chest and head before he has the chance to react. the FIRE WIZARD is dead.
you pull out THE MAGNUM DONG DILDO SWORD. the sword PENETRATES the wizards torso, impaling him and killing him instantly.
