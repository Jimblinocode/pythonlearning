# 2d lists and recursive functions

# 1D lists are only exist at one axis, and are just a simple row of items
    # typicallist= [1, bingus, dingus, 3, 4]
# 2d lists exist as rows and columns
    # ex2d = [
    # 
    # [b, i, n, g, u, s],
    # [i, n, g, u, s, b],
    # [n, g, u, s, b, i],
    # [g, u, s, b, i, n],
    # 
    # ]
# 3d lists are lists within lists within lists, and so on so forth 

# recursive functions
# functions that call on themselves
